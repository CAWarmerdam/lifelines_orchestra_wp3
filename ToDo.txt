ToDo

1. Derivation of variables
- Derive all needed variables using the variable names of the document VariableDerivation29082023.docx (located in the main folder).

2. Running of R Code
- the R code is included in an R markdown file in order to have a report with results at the end to share
- Open the R Project "Lifelines" located in the main folder
- Open the R Code "reportRQ2_Lifelines.Rmd"
- install all needed R libraries
- Add the name of your long format dataset (including 3 waves: COVQ24, COVQ27 and COVQ29) file on line 71 after "Data/"
- long format data should indlude variable named "VISIT" with categories 0, 1 and 2 to distinguish between the waves.
- Put your data in the folder "Data" or change the path on line 71 to read in the data
- line 344: Add information on how the number of Covid-19 infections per participants was derived
- lines 221: change name of variable to the one that distinguished between the waves to only have data of wave COVQ29
- run the R code chunks one by one to see if it runs without errors
- chunk 20 (lines 878 - 885), chunk 38 (lines 1021 - 1028), chunk 56 (lines 1161 - 1169), chunk 74 (lines 1302 - 1308), chunk 92 (lines 1440 - 1446)
  and chunk 110 (lines 1577 - 1584) only need to be run once. As these chunks are really time consuming, the results get saved and can be loaded in 
  each following chunk. To avoid to have the run every time, comment these chunks after they run successfully once.


3. Results
- Send back the report and the Results folder of each RQ after everything ran successfully
